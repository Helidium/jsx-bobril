## 0.3.0 / 2015-01-27

* Changed license back to MIT, now that React is licensed under BSD.

* Merged in changes since JSX Transformer 0.10.0 up to the current release
  version, 0.12.2:
  * The `/* @jsx m */` pragma is no longer needed - Mithril's `m()` function is
    assumed to be in scope.
  * More [ES6 transforms](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#jsx) are
    supported when using the `harmony` flag.
  * [JSX Spread Attributes](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-spread.html)
    allow you to merge objects into a tag's attrs, but with MSX you must ensure
    `Object.assign()` is available in order to use them.
  * More HTML and SVG tag names are supported.
  * Inline sourcemaps can be generated by passing a `sourceMap: true` option (or
    `--source-map-inline` flag on the command line).
